"""symbol-recall dataset generation — git-grounded, `symbols`-table-free (H1).

Gold for a symbol S is built from three independent, non-circular signals:

1. `code_touches` — which files an exchange *edited* (Edit/Write/MultiEdit),
   populated directly from harness tool-call paths at index time,
   independent of tree-sitter. Deliberately not `exchange_files`, which also
   records mere file *reads* — `loci context <file>:<symbol>` promises
   git-blame semantics ("who edited this"), not "who ever looked at this".
   Building gold from reads-included data measured >85% false negatives
   against exchanges the feature was never meant to surface.
2. A literal token match for S in the exchange's *raw* verbatim text.
3. Optionally, git history: which branches contain a commit whose diff for
   S's file mentions S, intersected with the exchange's own `git_branch`.

Crucially, gold construction never reads `symbols`/`code_symbols`/`code_edges`
— those are populated by the exact mechanism under test
(`eval/adapters/symbol.py`). Using them to build gold would make H1 self-
confirming. Tree-sitter is used only to *enumerate* which symbol names exist
in the current HEAD checkout (a fact about the code, not about lociaction's
historical resolution of it).

`enumerate_head_symbols` / `_load_file_history` / `_branches_containing` are
the only impure (git/tree-sitter I/O) functions here; `gold_for_symbol` and
`generate_symbol_recall_queries(..., allowed_branches_fn=...)` are unit-
testable against an in-memory DB with fake git info injected.
