# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `loci eval gate` (issue #37) is a CI regression gate for symbol-recall.
  It builds a tiny synthetic git+`code_edges` fixture (no network, no
  embeddings, no dogfood corpus) and fails if MRR@10 drops more than an
  absolute 0.01 against committed `src/lociaction/eval/baseline.json`.
  Keyword-recall (BM25/HNSW/RRF) remains out of scope.

- `loci status` now surfaces the most recent distill per-row failure
  (`exchange_id`, message, timestamp) from `meta` when one has been
  recorded; the field/section is omitted when nothing failed.

- `loci recall --file X --branch Y --json` (issue #33) is a session-start
  warmup that merges code-anchored `context` lookup with `search_combined`
  into one deduplicated response (`exchange_core` / `specific_context` /
  `verbatim_ref`). `--file` and `--branch` are independent AND filters.
  Ranking applies an opt-in exponential recency decay
  (`search_combined(..., recency_half_life_days=)`, default half-life 14 days
  on `loci recall` only; existing `search()`/`context()` ranking is unchanged)
  using `code_edges.ts` with `conversations.started_at` as fallback.

- `loci gc` (issue #30) snapshots the database, removes only orphaned
  palace/vector and exchange/session records, retains bounded `.bak` archives,
  and compacts the database with `VACUUM`.

- `loci hook install`/`uninstall --harness omp-pi|opencode|grok` now write real
  native hooks (issue #40): `OmpPiHooks`/`OpenCodeHooks` generate a marker-owned
  `~/.omp/agent/extensions/lociaction.ts` / `~/.config/opencode/plugins/lociaction.ts`
  plugin file (`DedicatedFileWriter`), and `GrokHooks` merges into a dedicated
  `~/.grok/hooks/lociaction.json` (`MergedJsonHookWriter`, shared with the new
  `CodexHooks`). All three previously always failed via `FallbackHooks`, which
  remains the safety net for unrecognized harnesses.

### Changed
- Database schema v14 removes unused `vec_exchanges`, obsolete
  `code_touches.symbol_name`/`resolved_by`, and duplicate `symbols` storage.
  Existing live legacy symbol relations migrate to `code_symbols` plus
  `code_edges` before the old table is dropped.

- Lifecycle event → loci command mapping (`Stop`→`index`, `SessionStart`→
  `server start`/`distill`/`prime`, compact→`prime`) is now a single source of
  truth: `lociaction.adapters.harness.lifecycle.lifecycle_commands(harness,
  batch_limit)`. `ClaudeHooks`/`CodexHooks`/`GrokHooks`/`OmpPiHooks`/
  `OpenCodeHooks` all derive their commands from it instead of re-deriving
  the mapping per harness (`lociaction.hooks.install_hooks`/`uninstall_hooks`
  keep their Claude-specific JSON-merge/idempotency logic, only the command
  strings themselves are now sourced from the shared helper). One observable
  side effect: Claude's `Stop` hook now runs `loci index --harness claude`
  instead of the previous bare `loci index` (which implicitly swept every
  detected harness on each Claude turn), matching the scoping Codex already had.
- `DedicatedFileWriter` uninstall only ever deletes files carrying its own
  `LOCIACTION_HOOK_MARKER`; files without the marker (other tools' extensions/
  plugins sharing the same auto-discovered directory) are left untouched on
  both install (no clobber) and uninstall (no delete).

### Fixed

- `loci search`'s KNN→filter ordering and branch matching (issue #18):
  - `search_hnsw_palace` cut the sqlite-vec KNN candidate pool to exactly
    `limit` *before* applying the `min_exchanges`/`branch` filters, so a
    branch- or activity-filtered query could silently drop to zero results
    even when relevant matches existed just outside the initial top-K. The
    candidate pool is now widened adaptively: it starts at `limit * 5`, and
    if filtering leaves fewer than `limit` results while unexplored candidates
    remain in `vec_palace`, the pool doubles and the query retries (bounded by
    a `2000`-candidate hard cap so worst-case ANN cost stays finite even under
    a highly selective filter). The final result count is still enforced with
    an outer `LIMIT`.
  - `search_bm25`/`search_hnsw_palace`'s `branch` filter interpolated the
    user-supplied branch string into a `LIKE '%...%'` pattern unescaped, so
    literal `%`/`_` in the query were interpreted as SQL wildcards (e.g.
    `main` incorrectly matching `maintenance`/`feat/main-x`). Wildcard
    characters are now escaped (new `lociaction.utils.escape_like`) and the
    clause carries an explicit `ESCAPE '\\'`; substring matching on
    non-wildcard input is unchanged.
- Embedding server lifecycle races (issue #16): `loci server start` now serializes
  the check→spawn→ready-wait sequence behind a process-wide `server.lock`
  (`fcntl.flock`), eliminating double-spawn/orphaning under concurrent sessions.
  `run_server` pings an existing socket before binding and refuses to clobber a
  live server. `loci server status` is now strictly read-only and never deletes
  a busy-but-unresponsive socket. `Embedder` serializes `model.encode` calls
  across threads (`SentenceTransformer` inference is not thread-safe). The
  embedder server now removes its PID file on idle-timeout/stop, not just the
  socket.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Branch linking: exchanges are linked to their git branch at index time.
- `loci search "query" --branch NAME` — branch-filtered semantic search.
- `loci context --branch NAME` — reverse lookup from a git branch to past conversations (includes undistilled exchanges).
- `loci context --full` flag; the default output is now lighter.
- `loci hook uninstall` — remove lociaction hooks from `settings.json`.
- SQLite hardening: WAL mode, `busy_timeout`, and a `user_version`-based migration framework.
- Distillation transactions with `distill_status` and version tracking, plus new indexes.

### Changed

- `loci prime` output rewritten around agent-action triggers with concrete examples.
- Distillation uses a flock-based lock; embeddings are serialized with `tobytes`.
- Hook registration writes `settings.json` atomically.
- Indexing is incremental and reports config errors explicitly.

### Fixed

- Silent data loss in the distillation pipeline; code reverse-lookup works again.
- Embedding server can no longer double-start; socket protocol hardened and connection leaks fixed.
- Ply coordinate drift and WAL sidecar file permissions.
- `loci prime` exits silently when `.lociaction/` is absent; resolving `.lociaction/` from a parent directory now notifies on stderr.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

- `loci init --no-hooks` flag to skip automatic Claude Code hook registration.
- `EmbedderSetupError` exception for environment-level embedder failures (distinguishes them from per-row errors).
- SVG banner at the top of the README (`assets/banner.svg`, generated via Freeze).
- `scripts/generate-banner.sh` to regenerate the banner from the live CLI output.

### Changed

- `loci init` now registers Claude Code hooks automatically at the end of setup — previously required a separate `loci hook install` step. Use `--no-hooks` to opt out.
- Interactive prompts re-prompt on invalid input instead of silently falling back to a default. The "run distillation now?" prompt now accepts `y`/`n`/`yes`/`no` in addition to `1`/`2`.
- Custom exchange counts are range-validated (`1..total`) and custom `min_chars` requires `>= 0`.
- Startup banner uses the pagga half-block font with a blue vertical gradient.

### Fixed

- `loci init` cleans up `.lociaction/` automatically if the execution phase fails or is interrupted (`KeyboardInterrupt`), so re-running is safe.
- A single corrupt `.jsonl` no longer aborts the whole indexing loop — it logs a warning and continues.
- `git_root()` catches `FileNotFoundError` when the `git` binary is missing.
- `parse_exchanges` returns `[]` for missing files instead of raising.
- Distillation failures from `sentence_transformers` import issues (e.g. numpy/pyarrow binary mismatch) now print a single friendly message with remediation hints instead of a full traceback followed by per-row error spam.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- `loci init` — initialize `.lociaction/` in project root
- `loci index` — parse `.jsonl` session logs, split into exchanges, embed with multilingual-e5-small
- `loci distill` — distill exchanges via `claude --print` into palace objects (exchange_core, specific_context, room_assignments)
- `loci search` — cross-layer RRF fusion search (BM25 verbatim + HNSW distilled)
- `loci context` — reverse lookup: code symbol → past conversations
- `loci show` — fetch verbatim exchange by ref
- `loci status` — show index state
- `loci server start/stop/status` — Unix socket embedding server for <0.2s search
- `loci hook install` — register Claude Code SessionStart/Stop hooks
- `config.toml` support for distill model and batch limit
- tree-sitter symbol resolution (Python, TypeScript, Go)
- Bilingual support (Japanese + English) via multilingual-e5-small
